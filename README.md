# MATG-557-Machine-Learning
This repository archives Machine learning algorithms created during Spring 2016 with Dr. Mark Debonis (Manhattan College). 
All algorithms are coded in MATLAB with respective data files in directory folder. Note: this git repo contains working code 
for all projects save for #8(Heirarchical Clustering) and #10(Distance Threshold) which I will debug and post ASAP!
